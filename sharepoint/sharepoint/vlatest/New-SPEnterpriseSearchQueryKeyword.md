# New-SPEnterpriseSearchQueryKeyword

## SYNOPSIS
Adds a keyword term to a shared search application.

## SYNTAX

```
New-SPEnterpriseSearchQueryKeyword [-AssignmentCollection <SPAssignmentCollection>] [-Confirm]
 [-Contact <String>] [-Definition <String>] [-EndDate <DateTime>] [-ReviewDate <DateTime>]
 -Site <SPSitePipeBind> [-StartDate <DateTime>] -Term <String> [-WhatIf]
```

## DESCRIPTION
The New-SPEnterpriseSearchQueryKeyword cmdlet changes query results by creating a new keyword.
A query keyword is a query component of a query topology.
SPEnterpriseSearchQueryKeyword represents relevance setting through keywords.

You can use this cmdlet for keywords in site collections that are in SharePoint Server 2010 mode.
You cannot use this cmdlet after a site collection is upgraded to SharePoint Server 2013 mode because keywords and Best Bets are automatically migrated to query rules.

For permissions and the most current information about Windows PowerShell for SharePoint Products, see the online documentation at http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=251831 (http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=251831).

### ------------------EXAMPLE------------------ (SharePoint Server 2016)
```
C:\PS>New-SPEnterpriseSearchQueryKeyword -Term Tangible -Site http://myserver/sites/team
```

This example creates a new query keyword for the site http://myserver/sites/team with the term Tangible.

## PARAMETERS

### -AssignmentCollection
Below Content Applies To: SharePoint Server 2013

{{Fill AssignmentCollection Description}} Below Content Applies To: SharePoint Server 2016

Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal.
Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management.
Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory.
When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store.
If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the Stop-SPAssignment command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.
