## PARAMETERS

### -Identity
Below Content Applies To: SharePoint Server 2013

Specifies the result source to delete.
The type must be a valid GUID string, in the form 12345678-90ab-cdef-1234-567890bcdefgh; a valid name of a result source (for example, "Custom SharePoint Result Source"); or an instance of a valid Source object.
Below Content Applies To: SharePoint Server 2016

Specifies the result source to delete.
The result source cannot be a built in source.
The type must be a valid GUID string, in the form 12345678-90ab-cdef-1234-567890bcdefgh; a valid name of a result source (for example, "Custom SharePoint Result Source"); or an instance of a valid Source object.

```yaml
Type: ResultSourcePipeBind
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 

Required: True
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Owner
Below Content Applies To: SharePoint Server 2013

Specifies the search object owner and its level to retrieve result source.
Below Content Applies To: SharePoint Server 2016

Specifies the search object owner that defines the scope at which the corresponding result source is available.

```yaml
Type: SearchObjectOwner
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: o

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -SearchApplication
Below Content Applies To: SharePoint Server 2013

The type must be a valid GUID, in the form 12345678-90ab-cdef-1234-567890bcdefgh; a valid search application name (for example, SearchApp1); or an instance of a valid SearchServiceApplication object Below Content Applies To: SharePoint Server 2016

Specifies the search application.
The type must be a valid GUID, in the form 12345678-90ab-cdef-1234-567890bcdefgh; a valid search application name (for example, SearchApp1); or an instance of a valid SearchServiceApplication object.

```yaml
Type: SearchServiceApplicationPipeBind
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 

Required: True
Position: Named
Default value: None

```

### -AssignmentCollection
Below Content Applies To: SharePoint Server 2013

Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal.
Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management.
Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory.
When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store.
If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the Stop-SPAssignment command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.
