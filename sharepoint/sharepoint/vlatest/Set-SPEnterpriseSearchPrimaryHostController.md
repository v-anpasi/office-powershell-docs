## DESCRIPTION
Below Content Applies To: SharePoint Server 2013

This cmdlet sets the primary SearchHostController for the farm to the defined SearchHostController.

The SearchHostController is related to the SearchServiceInstance, where the SearchHostController manages the search components that run on a server, and maintains a local repository for linguistic dictionaries.
The search components retrieve the linguistic dictionaries from the PrimaryHostController.

## PARAMETERS

### -SearchServiceInstance
SearchServiceInstance of the server from where the SearchHostController object is returned.

```yaml
Type: SearchServiceInstancePipeBind
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 

Required: True
Position: 1
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -AssignmentCollection
Manages objects for the purpose of proper disposal.
Use of objects, such as SPWeb or SPSite, can use large amounts of memory and use of these objects in Windows PowerShell scripts requires proper memory management.
Using the SPAssignment object, you can assign objects to a variable and dispose of the objects after they are needed to free up memory.
When SPWeb, SPSite, or SPSiteAdministration objects are used, the objects are automatically disposed of if an assignment collection or the Global parameter is not used.

When the Global parameter is used, all objects are contained in the global store.
If objects are not immediately used, or disposed of by using the Stop-SPAssignment command, an out-of-memory scenario can occur.

```yaml
Type: SPAssignmentCollection
Parameter Sets: (All)
Aliases: 

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: True (ByValue)
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

```

### -Force
